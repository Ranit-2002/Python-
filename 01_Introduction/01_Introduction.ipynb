    "## History of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer.\n",
    "Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability and simplicity, with its syntax allowing programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.\n",
    "The first version, Python 0.9.0, was released in February 1991.\n",
    "Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced many new features, including list comprehensions and a garbage collection system.\n",
    "Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not entirely backward-compatible. However, it introduced features to enhance simplicity and eliminate redundant features."
