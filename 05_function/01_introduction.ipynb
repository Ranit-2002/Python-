Functions provide modularity, allowing you to break down a program into smaller, manageable pieces. Here are some key characteristics and points related to functions in Python:\n","\n","# Characteristics :\n","Functions in programming languages, including Python, exhibit several key characteristics that contribute to their usefulness and versatility. Here are some fundamental characteristics of functions:\n","\n","* **Modularity :**\n","Functions allow code to be divided into smaller, independent modules. Each function can perform a specific task, promoting code organization and reusability.\n","\n","* **Reusability :**\n","Functions can be reused in different parts of a program or in different programs altogether, reducing the need to duplicate code and promoting a more maintainable codebase.\n","\n","* **Abstraction :**\n","Functions provide a level of abstraction, allowing a programmer to focus on the functionality of a particular task without needing to understand the implementation details. This enhances code readability and simplifies complex systems.\n","\n","* **Parameterization :**\n","Functions can accept parameters (input values) that influence their behavior. This parameterization allows for flexibility and customization of function functionality based on different inputs.\n","\n","* **Return Values :**\n","Functions can return values as a result of their execution. This allows them to produce output that can be used elsewhere in the program. If no return statement is present, the function returns None by default.\n","\n","* **Scope :**\n","Functions have their own local scope, which means variables defined within a function are local to that function. This local scope helps prevent naming conflicts with variables in other parts of the program.\n","\n","* **Recursion :**\n","Functions can call themselves, a concept known as recursion. Recursive functions are useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.\n","\n","* **Encapsulation :**\n","Functions encapsulate a specific piece of functionality, providing a clear interface to the rest of the program. The internal details of a function are hidden, and only the function's name, parameters, and return values are exposed.\n","\n","* **Docstrings :**\n","Functions can include documentation strings (docstrings) that describe their purpose, parameters, return values, and usage. Docstrings serve as a form of inline documentation to help other developers understand and use the function.\n","\n","* **Default Values :**\n","Parameters in a function can have default values, making them optional when the function is called. This feature enhances the flexibility of function usage.\n","\n","* **Lambda Functions :**\n","Lambda functions, or anonymous functions, provide a concise way to create small, one-time-use functions without the need for a formal function definition.\n","\n","* **First-class Citizens :**\n","In Python, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from other functions.\n","\n","Understanding and utilizing these characteristics effectively can help programmers write cleaner, more modular, and maintainable code.\n","\n","\n","Syntax for Function Definition:\n","\n","* Use the def keyword to define a function.\n","* Followed by the function name and parentheses ().\n","* Parameters (if any) are placed inside the parentheses.\n","* End the function definition with a colon :"],"metadata":{"id":"TcIPXJDHYQIl"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):\n","    # Function body"],"metadata":{"id":"wr1px_LVZDEn"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Creating a function to Greet People**"],"metadata":{"id":"sY4oGGMvb-sl"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def greet():\n","  name = input(\"Enter Your Name : \")\n","  print(\"Hello!\", name, \"welcome to the Company, Have a nice day!\")"],"metadata":{"id":"elveA8aVb618","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708448533405,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":488,"user":{"displayName":"Ranit Sundar Chatterjee","userId":"10758453032952561235"}}},"execution_count":26,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["greet()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"U782XGJocaSO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708448522950,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":8324,"user":{"displayName":"Ranit Sundar Chatterjee","userId":"10758453032952561235"}},"outputId":"72c303e7-db0b-49c4-e675-9403a8532451"},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Enter Your Name : Chris\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["('Hello!', 'Chris', 'welcome to the Company, Have a nice day!')"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":24}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Creating another function to multiply two numbers**"],"metadata":{"id":"n27rfZbOd_zz"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def multiply(a, b):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Multiply two numbers.\n","\n","    Parameters:\n","    - a: First number\n","    - b: Second number\n","\n","    Returns:\n","    Result of the multiplication\n","    \"\"\"\n","    return a * b"],"metadata":{"id":"7WJVEM3wcgpK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708448602135,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":572,"user":{"displayName":"Ranit Sundar Chatterjee","userId":"10758453032952561235"}}},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["multiply(8, 10)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"fCpEMwmzd5yT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708448611838,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Ranit Sundar Chatterjee","userId":"10758453032952561235"}},"outputId":"4474aba6-e014-4b87-e59e-9d66a28ebe4c"},"execution_count":29,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["80"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":29}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"4dJKaeMTePp7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
